# Pacman-x86

A Pacman version implemented in pure x86 assembly.

## Motivation
When you want to do something different with your spare time, or when you just want
to procrastinate and leave what must be done for another moment, you come up with
the weirdest ideas.

I wanted for a long time to (re)implement a pac-man game in pure assembly. Now,
you might be asking yourself: "Why would anyone want to do such a thing?"

The answer is quite simple: it would be a _fun_ way to (re)learn at least the basics
of OpenGL and x86-assembly.

Feel free to use this project however you want to. You might learn some things as
well.

## Install
To compile this project, you must have both libraries `OpenGL` and `GLUT` installed
in your system, download the source files and simply run the commands below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodriados/pacman-x86.git
make
```

Have fun!
